The purpose of this project was to analyze some nba data to see if we could find any interesting trends with the way referees call games for home teams vs. visiting teams.

We analyzed data from the 2015-2017 NBA seasons.
Here are the aspects we looked at:

* Home Team vs. Visiting Team foul discrepancies
* The most biased referees in the NBA
* Technical foul discrepancies between certain teams
* Teams that get called for the most technical fouls for all officials
