    <div align="center" style="font-size:30px; width:1000px;  margin: 0 auto">Introduction:<p>
        Halfway through the NBA 2017-2018 season, one of the most noticeable differences of this season from previous ones is the growing divide among players and referees' opinions of the decision of certain officiating calls. This has resulted in heavy criticism of the officiating jobs done by the referees by the players. So, we tried to look into the statistics of the referees' foul calls and technical foul calls from the past few seasons to see if there were any inconsistencies.
        </p>
    
    <div align="center" style="font-size:30px; width:1000px;  margin: 0 auto">What we did:
                Interested in home court advantage, we looked into foul calls made by each referee
                in every game of the season. After scraping the data off stats.nba.com, we graphed
                the number of calls made when the referee is on the court, as well as the approximate
                number of fouls they actively called, and the average number of technical fouls they called
                on each team in a certain division.
                
                For each NBA game, there are three referees on the court. Each one surveys only a specific part of the floor, but if one referee believes
                an instance of contact warrants a foul, they will make their own individual decision to call it a foul.

    Notable Trends/Observations:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
            <li>On average, home teams (listed in black) get called for about 19.69 fouls, while away teams (listed in red) get called for more fouls, at 20.89.</li>
                <li>For a majority of the referees, home teams get an advantage because they are called for fewer fouls than the visiting team.</li>
            <li>However, this does not account for the fact that referees work in group of threes, so a referee working with another referee who makes many calls will also increase their foul calls in this chart.</li>

    Notable Trends/Observations:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
        <li>From the previous graph, we adjusted for the fact that other referees make their own calls, which can increase the number of foul calls for the other referees on the court. We adjusted
            this using least square approximation which led to an estimation of the number of foul calls an individual referee will make.</li>
        <li>For instance, in the first Celtics@Cavaliers game, for referees Monty McCutchen, Michael Smith, and Brian Forte, the total number of foul calls they called on the visiting team was 24. Let the number of calls that Monty McCutchen made be x1, the number of calls that Michael Smith made be x2, and the number of calls that Brian Forte made be x3. Then the number of calls can be represented by x1 + x2 + x3 = 24. Taking this equation from every game in the season, we minimized the square error for each referee to get the number of calls that each referee makes.
            </li>
        <li>As you can see from the results of this graph and the previous one, referees Kevin Cutler and Leroy Richardson have wide discrepancies between the number of calls they give for
            the home team and the number of calls they give the visiting team.</li>

    Notable Trends/Observations:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
        <li>This graph shows the averaged number of technical fouls that each referee gives to each team. We calculated the number of technical fouls each referee team gave to a basketball team and then divided it by the number of games that referee officiated a game the team played in. The teams shown in this graph are the teams in the Atlantic Division, for simplicity
            purposes. As you can see, the green lengths of each bar are quite longer than others, showing that the Knicks' behavior warrants more technical fouls, as shown by the distribution
            among all the refs.</li>
        <li>However, the inconsistency in officiating is shown by the fact that referees such as Dedric Taylor give out more techncial fouls than other referees. His standard for what he believes
            warrants a technical foul is much lower than other referees because he gives them out much more.</li>
        <li>As a result, hotheaded teams such as the Knicks will suffer more from this part of the NBA rulebook which involves the referee's personal opinion about what constitutes a technical foul.</li>

            <li>This graph shows the same type of data as the graph above. However, this bar graph shows the technical fouls for the Pacific Division.</li>
            <li>Another interesting type of inconsistency arises with the distribution of the technical fouls for the Clippers. Approximately half of the referees give the Clippers a lot of technical fouls. In fact, many referees give the Clippers on average about half of all the technical fouls that they give the Pacific Division.</li>
            <li>However, the inconsistency arises with the other half of the referee body. Many referees give the Clippers so few technical fouls in comparison to the other teams in the Pacific Division that they are the smallest distribution for that referee's average. This shows that the rules for what deterine a technical foul are almost completely dependent on what the referees's personal beliefs are for what warrants a technical foul.</li>
