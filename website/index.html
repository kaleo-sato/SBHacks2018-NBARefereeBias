    <div align="center" style="font-size:30px; width:1000px;  margin: 0 auto">Introduction:
        Halfway through the NBA 2017-2018 season, one of the most noticeable differences of this season from previous ones is the growing divide among and criticism of the officiating jobs done by the referees.

    <div align="center" style="font-size:30px; width:1000px;  margin: 0 auto">What we did:
                Interested in home court advantage, we looked into foul calls made by each referee
                in every game of the season. After scraping the data off stats.nba.com, we graphed
                the number of calls made when the referee is on the court, as well as ...

    Notable Trends/Observations:
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
            <li>On average, home teams (listed in orange) get called for -temp- of fouls, while away teams (listed in gray) get called for more fouls, at -temp-.</li>
            <li>While the referees are on the court, for a majority of the referees, home teams get an advantage because they are called for fewer fouls than the visiting team.</li>
            <li>However, this does not account for the fact that referees work in group of threes, so a referee working with another referee who makes many calls will also increase their foul calls in this chart.</li>

    Notable Trends/Observations:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
        <li>Mediterranean Ave. is by far the worst. The property takes 30 instances of people landing on it in order to pay its cost back through its basic rent, and on top of that, it is one of the most uncommonly landed on squares in the game.</li>
        <li>The Railroads and Utilities are good for quick money. Their rents can jump up to the highest out of all the rents in the game. However, because you cannot build houses on these properties, they are only good for early game if you can hold multiple of each.</li>
        <li>Illinois Ave. and Boardwalk make their money back the quickest through rent. Illinois Ave. is the second most popular square on the board (behind Jail Cell), and Boardwalk has a high rent in comparison to its buy cost.</li>
        <li>The formula we used to calculate rolls needed: Number_of_turns_to_break_even = (Cost)/(Rent*Probability_to_land_on_it)</li>

    Notable Trends/Observations:
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc; font-size:20px; text-align:center; margin: 0 auto">
        <li>The graph shows five different situations. The first set of all the board colors represent the number of rolls it takes to pay back all costs of the property with one house on it. The second set displays the number of rolls assuming there are two houses, etc.</li>
        <li>The addition of the third house is more efficient as opposed to building one house or two houses on all the properties.</li>
        <li>The addition of the fourth house and the eventual building of the hotel don't actually decrease the number of rolls it takes to break even. What it does change is the player's ability to bankrupt others. However, it is also risky because you will most likely be digging yourself out of the financial costs that the building costs.</li>
